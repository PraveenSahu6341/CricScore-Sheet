# CricXperience - Cicket Match Simulation Project

This project is a cricket match simulation program implemented in C. The program allows users to experience the thrill of a cricket match by simulating the game between two teams. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input details of the teams, such as player names and roles.

**Features:**

1. **Team Setup:** Users can set up two cricket teams by entering the names of players and their respective roles (e.g., batsman, bowler, all-rounder).

2. **Toss:** The program conducts a toss to decide which team will bat or field first, adding an element of unpredictability to the simulation.

3. **Overs Configuration:** Users can choose the number of overs for the match, allowing them to simulate different match formats like T20, ODI, or Test matches.

4. **Real-time Match Simulation:** Once the match begins, the program simulates each over, keeping track of the runs scored, wickets taken, extras, and other essential statistics. It provides real-time updates on the scores and player details during the match.

5. **Intuitive Interface:** The program offers a simple and intuitive interface, where users can use shortcut keys to input events like no balls, wides, wickets, etc.

6. **Scorecard Generation:** After the match concludes, the program generates a comprehensive scorecard. The scorecard includes detailed statistics for each player, such as runs scored, balls faced, strike rate, boundaries, etc. It also displays the total runs scored, wickets taken, and extras for both teams.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C program using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable file in your terminal.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input team details and configure the match.
5. During the match, use the provided shortcut keys to input events.
6. Once the match is over, view the generated scorecard to analyze the performance of individual players and both teams.
