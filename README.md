# CricScore Sheet

The project is a cricket match simulation program written in C. It allows users to input the details of two cricket teams, including player names and roles. The program then conducts a toss to decide which team will bat or field first. The user can choose the number of overs for the match.

During the match, the program simulates each over and keeps track of runs scored, wickets taken, extras (like no balls and wides), and other statistics. It also handles player rotations, strike changes, and provides a summary of each over.
The program prints real-time updates of the match, displaying the scores, the players on the crease, and the current bowler. It also provides a list of shortcut keys to input various events like no balls, wides, wickets, etc.

After the match is completed, the program generates a scorecard with detailed statistics for each player, including runs scored, balls faced, fours, sixes, strike rate, etc. It also displays the total runs scored, total wickets taken, and the extras.

Overall, the project simulates a cricket match and provides a user-friendly interface to follow and analyze the game's progress.
